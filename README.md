# Sign-Lang-Recognition-Android-App
This app pairs with myo band using bluetooth which is capable of sending EMG-data obtained by muscle contraction and relaxation in the forearm and sends data to the android phone which can record and detect gestures made.  The training and testing part takes place on a localhost server because the detection algorithms need processing power. The detection algorithms are tested with various machine learning algorithms for classification problems like KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, etc. An accuracy of ~60% is obtained when trained and tested with a dataset involving same user.
